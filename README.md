## JSON Viewer
The _JSON Viewer_ app is a helpful tool that makes it incredibly easy to work with JSON.

You can start off by pasting a block of text in the _Edit_ tab. There are options available for you to quickly perform certain actions such as format (i.e. auto-indent) or minimize.

In the _View_ tab, a tree structure will be generated to help you visualize the JSON object in the UI.
